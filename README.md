# QEM_Spectrometer
Code for simulating and designing our spectrometer for an SEM

Code includes:
- Lorentz Files for ray tracing of the various components including
1. The EELS Spectrometer
2. The preconditioning lens systems
3. The deflectors
4. The gun
- MATLAB files for initializing th electron beam traces
- MATLAB files for analytic expressions such as deflection and lensing
- MATLAB files for extracting parameters and plots from Lorentz, as well as for calculating coefficients
